# StudentPerformancePrediction

Educational organizations are one of the important parts of our society and playing a vital role for growth and
development of any nation. Educational data mining is the application of data mining. It is an emerging
interdisciplinary research area that deals with the development of methods to explore data originating in an educational
context. Educational data mining is an emerging trend, designed for automatically exploring the unique types of data
from large repositories of educationally related data. Quite often, this data is extensive, fine grained, and precise. The
main objective of this paper is to use data mining methodologies to study students performance in the courses. Data
mining provides many tasks that could be used to study the student performance. In this research, the classification task
is used to evaluate students performance and as there are many approaches that are used for data classification, the
decision tree method is used here. Information like Attendance, Class test, Seminar and Assignment marks were
collected from the students management system, to predict the performance at the end of the semester. This paper
investigates the accuracy of Decision tree techniques for predicting student performance. The faculty cannot find out
students abilities and their interest easily so that they can enhance them in it. Thus it may affect with poor university
results, placement and career of individual. The impact is- it help us from fulfilling mission and vision of the institute.
If the project get successful then it will be great help for faculty to enhance education system.
